            <p style="color:#413620;">The construction of the official coffee exchange palace, a work by Companhia Construtora de Santos, in an eclectic style, is considered the most important work of the period.
            Style, volume, copper domes, large sculptures, stained glass, marble, the work of foreign craftsmen and works of art built the discourse that linked the coffee elite to the first bandeirantes as pioneer builders of a nation led by São Paulo.
            Thus, in 1920, Companhia Construtora de Santos began work on the building of the Official Coffee Exchange. The construction portrays a mixture of several architectural movements, especially the neoclassical and baroque styles.
            For the façade, Companhia Construtora de Santos purchased pink granite from Salto de Itu, designed by the Belgian architect Ernest Chaineux and executed by the stonemasons Antônio and José Longobardi.
            Right at the entrance we come across a small stained glass window above the doors with the symbol “United States of Brazil”, the name of our country on the date of opening of the building and the coat of arms of Brazil, composed of two branches: one of coffee and the other of smoke .
            The clock tower is about 40 meters high and at its top four sculptures stand out in architecture, representing agriculture, commerce, industry and the sailor.

The furniture is arranged in an octagonal shape and represents the hierarchy of the Exchange: the board of directors with the president in the center and brokers around it.

    This location currently corresponds to the region of Praça da República. Further ahead, the author begins to describe the buildings on the panel, starting with the Igreja da Misericórdia.
    It should be noted that in addition to the Church, the building housed the hospital that gave rise to the Santa Casa de Misericórdia de Santos.

        <p>In the work "PORT OF SANTOS IN 1822", we see the Jail and Conjunto do Carmo with the churches of the first and third order and the convent.
            From there you can see the Itororó stream, which has its source on Monte Serrat and flows into the port. Then, closer to the hill, we see Campo da Misericórdia with the church and Hospital da Santa Casa.
            Going a little further to the right towards the hill, we find Nossa Senhora do Rosário Church. Returning to the port area we see the Jesus Maria José church and advancing a little after the São Bento creek we can see the Conjunto do Valongo, administered by the Franciscans, with the church of Santo Antônio and the convent.
            In the frame of this panel we can see four medallions arranged at the ends. In the upper left corner we see a coat of arms with the inscription: Brasil Colônia 1549–1816. In the upper right corner we can read: Brasil-Kingdom 1816–1822.
            In the lower left corner — Work and Order, illustrated by a hive of bees. Bottom right — Farming and Commerce, illustrated by a winged helmet and the caduceus of Mercury, God of Commerce.

            In the frame of this panel we can see four medallions received at the ends. At the top left, it reads: Brazil Empire — 1822–1889. Top right: Brasil Republica—1889–1922.

        The stained glass window “A EPOPEIA DOS BANDEIRANTES” is divided into three parts, which refer to different historical moments in Brazil. In the center “The vision of Anhanguera, the Mãe D’Ouro and the Mães D’água”, representing the colonial period and the conquest of the sertões by the bandeirantes;
            on the sides “Agriculture and Abundance”, from the imperial period, and “Indústria e Commercio” from the republican period. In addition, it is composed of eight busts of bandeirantes and a frame decorated with agricultural genres, fauna, flora, and beings from Brazilian folklore.
            Despite seeking an interpretation of national history from the São Paulo perspective, Calixto chose a fantastic approach, full of allegories, mixing aspects of a classic European mythology with mythological elements, Brazilian fauna and flora.
            This composition, added to the tropical luminosity provided by the chosen glass colors, denote an intention to attribute a Brazilian quality to the work, even if in a conservative manner.

        This period, characterized by some authors as the Belle Epoque of Santos, began the need to build a monument that symbolized this economic peak.
